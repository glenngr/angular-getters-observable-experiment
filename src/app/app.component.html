<p>
	Using a getter to pipe onto an observable and manipulate data will always return a new instance every time the
	getter is called.
	<br>
	<br>
  Can this cause performance issues?
	<br>
	<br>
  Take a look at the console log. The getter that pipes onto the observable returns a new instance every change detection cycle.
	<br>
	<br>
  The getter that just returns an observable without piping onto it is always the same instance.

	<p>
		Data from observable getter1: {{ test1 | async}}
	</p>
	<p>
		Data from observable getter2: {{ test2 | async}}
	</p>
